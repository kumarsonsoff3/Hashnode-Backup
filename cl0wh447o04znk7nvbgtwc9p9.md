**Web development is an interesting yet challenging approach so here I'm sharing my bit of knowledge to abate complexity for you all.**

 HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It provides powerfull accessibility functions if used appropriately and Also can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 
In addition to this, it's easy to learn and has a lots of features that you can use as  Web developer.
Here, I'm going to show you some of the most Uncommon HTML tags. üòÄ

**1. Abbreviation :**
- The `<abbr>` tag in HTML5 is  the latest title.
- When the mouse curser is hovered on the title, it will display a full description in the tooltip form. 
- This element includes Global Attribute like: title.

- **Example :**
```
       <p> The most wonder key of your development is

**2. Acronym: **

-  The `<acronym>` is another abbreviation tag 
- In HTML5 `<acronym>` is not supported. In case we use the `<abbr>` tag
- The `<acronym>` tag is compatible in any browser as well as it is used to abbreviate the full form of the title whixh is placed between these tags when hovered.

- **Example :**

```
     <p> The <acronym title="world wide web">www</acronym>

**4. Cite :**
- The `<cite>` tag is the citation element of HTML. 
- Citation is the term which means a quotation from or reference to a book, paper, or author, especially in a scholarly work.
