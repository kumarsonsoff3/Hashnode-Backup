# Come Back After Long 8 Months ðŸ’¥

Hey everyone, ðŸ‘‹ I'm not sure if you remember me or not, because it has been way long since I've written something to you here. Some of you might be thinking who is this new person in your notifications or inbox? ðŸ˜‚

Don't worry, I'll not spam you. You can check out my past blogs [here](https://kumarsonsoff.hashnode.dev). The last one I've written was for the **Epic Writeathon** in May 2022, which was no. 13 of the [100 honourable mentions](https://townhall.hashnode.com/the-epic-hashnode-writeathon-the-winners#heading-100-honorable-mentions). And now on, I'll gonna write more about the things I learned on my way, tips, resources, and much more to come your way.

I've had a lot of awesome and many bad experiences in these 8 months, which I'll gonna share with you in upcoming articles. So hope you'll not regret giving me a little space in your inbox ðŸ˜„

> My biggest resolutions for the year are to **Contribute to atleast 100 GitHub Repos + Exhale myself in Public speaking. ðŸŽ¤**
> 
> Would love to know yours too, are you keeping up with them!?

Here is what my GitHub contribution graph for 2023 looks like. Getting back to code, all day every day, is much needed after a long break that I took in december. ðŸ˜„

So, Finally, I've committed to document my journey on my blog & to get updates straight to your inbox, you can subscribe to my newsletter [here](https://kumarsonsoff.hashnode.dev/newsletter).

I thought of not making this issue too long, so wrapping up by sharing an amazing website I came to know about ([Radio.garden](https://radio.garden/)). This webpage allows you to tour the world just by sitting at your desk only. ðŸŒŽ

You'll be able to hear the local radio of any place in the world you want, allows you to hear the heritage songs, local news, etc of that country. It's a kind of unique feeling hearing these. Feels like you are in the gardens of that place. ðŸ¥°

So go check it out, and have fun around. Happy weekend to you all. ðŸŽ‰ In the next issue we'll do some productive talks. ðŸ¤“
